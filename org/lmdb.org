* Use of LMDB in Cosdata
** LMDB
   - Cosdata uses LMDB for storing various metadata
   - https://www.symas.com/lmdb
   - Rust [[https://docs.rs/lmdb/latest/lmdb/][crate]]
** Databases
*** metadata
**** Keys
***** =current_version=
      version hash
***** =count_unindexed=
      To keep track of no. of embeddings that have been written to the
      ~vec_raw~ file but yet to be indexed
***** =count_indexed=
      No. of embeddings that have been indexed
***** =next_file_offset=
      File offset upto which embeddings have been written to the
      ~vec_raw~ file. Value is serialized form of ~EmbeddingOffset~
*** embeddings
    - Raw vector embeddings are stored as key-value pairs
    - Keys: Serialized ~VectorId~
    - Values: Offset to locate where the raw vector is written in the
      ~vec_raw~ file.
**** Why are embeddings offsets stored in lmdb?
     Purely in order to CRUD API to fetch vectors that are previously
     created. Not used for indexing and search operations
*** versions
    - Key: u32 hash obtained by performing bitwise operations on
      version and branch.
      + The =current_version= key in ~metadata~ db is a reference to
        one of the keys stored in this db.
    - Value: branch (u64) and version (u32) and timestamp (u32)
      serialized together (total size 16 bytes).
*** branches
    - Key: branch id as (le) bytes (u32)
    - Value: serialized ~BranchInfo~ struct
